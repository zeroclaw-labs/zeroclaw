## Our Trademarks

The following are trademarks of ZeroClaw Labs:

- **ZeroClaw** (word mark)
- **zeroclaw-labs** (organization name)
- The ZeroClaw logo and associated visual identity

These marks identify the official ZeroClaw project and distinguish it from
unauthorized forks, derivatives, or impersonators.

---

## Official Repository

The **only** official ZeroClaw repository is:

> https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw

Any other repository, organization, domain, or product claiming to be
"ZeroClaw" or implying affiliation with ZeroClaw Labs is unauthorized and
may constitute trademark infringement.

**Known unauthorized forks:**
- `openagen/zeroclaw` — not affiliated with ZeroClaw Labs

If you encounter an unauthorized use, please report it by opening an issue
at https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues.

## Permitted Uses

You **may** use the ZeroClaw name and marks in the following ways without
prior written permission:

1. **Attribution** — stating that your software is based on or derived from
   ZeroClaw, provided it is clear your project is not the official ZeroClaw.

2. **Descriptive reference** — referring to ZeroClaw in documentation,
   articles, blog posts, or presentations to accurately describe the software.

3. **Community discussion** — using the name in forums, issues, or social
   media to discuss the project.

4. **Fork identification** — identifying your fork as "a fork of ZeroClaw"
   with a clear link to the official repository.

---

## Prohibited Uses

You **may not** use the ZeroClaw name or marks in ways that:

1. **Imply official endorsement** — suggest your project, product, or
   organization is officially affiliated with or endorsed by ZeroClaw Labs.

2. **Cause brand confusion** — use "ZeroClaw" as the primary name of a
   competing or derivative product in a way that could confuse users about
   the source.

3. **Impersonate the project** — create repositories, domains, packages,
   or accounts that could be mistaken for the official ZeroClaw project.

4. **Misrepresent origin** — remove or obscure attribution to ZeroClaw Labs
   while distributing the software or derivatives.

5. **Commercial trademark use** — use the marks in commercial products,
   services, or marketing without prior written permission from ZeroClaw Labs.

## Fork Guidelines

Forks are welcome under the terms of the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses. If
you fork ZeroClaw, you must:

- Not imply your fork is the official or original project
- Retain all copyright, license, and attribution notices

---

## Contributor Protections

Contributors to the official ZeroClaw repository are protected under the
dual MIT + Apache 2.0 license model:

- **Patent grant** (Apache 2.0) — your contributions are protected from
  patent claims by other contributors.
- **Attribution** — your contributions are permanently recorded in the
  repository history and NOTICE file.
