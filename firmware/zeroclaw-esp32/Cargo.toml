# ZeroClaw ESP32 firmware — JSON-over-serial peripheral for host-mediated control.
#
# Flash to ESP32 and connect via serial. The host ZeroClaw sends gpio_read/gpio_write
# commands; this firmware executes them and responds.
#
# Prerequisites: espup (cargo install espup; espup install; source ~/export-esp.sh)
# Build: cargo build --release
# Flash: cargo espflash flash --monitor
