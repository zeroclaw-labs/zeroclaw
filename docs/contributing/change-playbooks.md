# Change Playbooks

Step-by-step guides for common extension and modification patterns in JhedaiClaw.

For complete code examples of each extension trait, see [extension-examples.md](./extension-examples.md).

## Adding a Provider

- Implement `Provider` in `src/providers/`.
- Register in `src/providers/mod.rs` factory.
- Add focused tests for factory wiring and error paths.
- Avoid provider-specific behavior leaks into shared orchestration code.

## Adding a Channel

- Implement `Channel` in `src/channels/`.
- Keep `send`, `listen`, `health_check`, typing semantics consistent.
- Cover auth/allowlist/health behavior with tests.

## Adding a Tool

- Implement `Tool` in `src/tools/` with strict parameter schema.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs.
- Return structured `ToolResult`; avoid panics in runtime path.

## Adding a Peripheral

- Implement `Peripheral` in `src/peripherals/`.
- Peripherals expose `tools()` — each tool delegates to the hardware (GPIO, sensors, etc.).
- Register board type in config schema if needed.
- See `docs/hardware/hardware-peripherals-design.md` for protocol and firmware notes.

## Security / Runtime / Gateway Changes

- Include threat/risk notes and rollback strategy.
- Add/update tests or validation evidence for failure modes and boundaries.
- Keep observability useful but non-sensitive.
- For `.github/workflows/**` changes, include Actions allowlist impact in PR notes and update `docs/contributing/actions-source-policy.md` when sources change.

## Docs System / README / IA Changes

- Treat docs navigation as product UX: preserve clear pathing from README -> docs hub -> SUMMARY -> category index.
- Keep top-level nav concise; avoid duplicative links across adjacent nav blocks.
- When runtime surfaces change, update related references in `docs/reference/`.
- Keep multilingual entry-point parity for all supported locales (`en`, `zh-CN`, `ja`, `ru`, `fr`, `vi`) when nav or key wording changes.
- When shared docs wording changes, sync corresponding localized docs in the same PR (or explicitly document deferral and follow-up PR).

## Architecture Boundary Rules

- Extend capabilities by adding trait implementations + factory wiring first; avoid cross-module rewrites for isolated features.
- Keep dependency direction inward to contracts: concrete integrations depend on trait/config/util layers, not on other concrete integrations.
- Avoid cross-subsystem coupling (e.g., provider code importing channel internals, tool code mutating gateway policy directly).
- Keep module responsibilities single-purpose: orchestration in `agent/`, transport in `channels/`, model I/O in `providers/`, policy in `security/`, execution in `tools/`.
- Introduce new shared abstractions only after repeated use (rule-of-three), with at least one real caller.
- For config/schema changes, treat keys as public contract: document defaults, compatibility impact, and migration/rollback path.
