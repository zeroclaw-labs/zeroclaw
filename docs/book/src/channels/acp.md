# ACP — Agent Client Protocol

**ACP** is a JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol over stdio that lets editors and IDEs drive a running ZeroClaw agent as a session host. Newline-delimited JSON — lightweight, streamable, easy to wire to a subprocess.

Think of it as "LSP for agents": the editor launches `zeroclaw acp`, sends prompts over stdin, and receives session updates on stdout.

## What you'd use it for

- An editor extension that offers an "ask the agent about this file" command
- A terminal multiplexer integration that opens a side pane with an agent session
- A CI runner that drives the agent programmatically without a full gateway setup
- Anything that wants agent sessions without HTTP and without binding a port

## Protocol shape — v1

All messages are JSON-RPC 2.0 (newline-delimited). ZeroClaw implements **protocol version 1**.

### `initialize`

Handshake. Returns server capabilities.

```json
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize"}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "agentCapabilities": {
      "loadSession": false,
      "promptCapabilities": {"image": false, "audio": false, "embeddedContext": false},
      "mcpCapabilities": {"http": false, "sse": false},
      "sessionCapabilities": {}
    },
    "agentInfo": {
      "name": "zeroclaw-acp",
      "title": "ZeroClaw ACP",
      "version": "0.7.x"
    },
    "authMethods": [],
    "_meta": {
      "zeroclaw": {
        "defaultModel": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6",
        "maxSessions": 10,
        "sessionTimeoutSecs": 3600
      }
    }
  }}
```

`_meta.zeroclaw` carries ZeroClaw-specific extension fields not in the base ACP spec. Clients that only implement the base spec can ignore this object.

The server always responds `protocolVersion: 1`. If you send a client-side `protocolVersion: 0`, you still get `1` back — v0 clients will see parse errors on the new message shapes; see [version compatibility](#version-compatibility) below.

### `session/new`

Open an isolated agent session. The optional `cwd` parameter (aliases: `workspaceDir`, `workspace_dir`) pins the per-session file-access boundary — it becomes the `workspace_dir` inside the `SecurityPolicy` that all file tools enforce. The agent's persistent data directory (memory, identity, cron) remains the daemon-level `workspace_dir` from config.

```json
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"session/new","params":{
    "cwd": "/path/to/project"
  }}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"result":{
    "sessionId": "s-ab12cd",
    "workspaceDir": "/path/to/project"
  }}
```

`cwd` is canonicalized on intake — `../` traversal cannot escape the intended root. If `cwd` is omitted, the server uses the daemon's launch directory.

### `session/prompt`

Send a prompt. The response is a sequence of `session/update` notifications streaming back, terminated by the `session/prompt` result.

```json
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"session/prompt","params":{
    "sessionId": "s-ab12cd",
    "prompt": "Summarise the changes in the last commit."
  }}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"session/update","params":{
    "sessionId": "s-ab12cd",
    "update": {"sessionUpdate": "agent_message_chunk", "content": {"type":"text","text":"The last commit..."}}
  }}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"session/update","params":{
    "sessionId": "s-ab12cd",
    "update": {"sessionUpdate": "tool_call", "toolCallId": "tc-1", "title": "shell",
               "kind": "execute", "status": "pending", "rawInput": {...}}
  }}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"session/update","params":{
    "sessionId": "s-ab12cd",
    "update": {"sessionUpdate": "tool_call_update", "toolCallId": "tc-1",
               "status": "finished", "rawOutput": "..."}
  }}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"result":{
    "sessionId": "s-ab12cd",
    "stopReason": "end_turn",
    "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "The last commit introduces..."}]
  }}
```

`stopReason` is `"end_turn"` on normal completion. The `content` array mirrors the final assistant message.

### `session/update` notifications (agent → client)

ZeroClaw sends four kinds of `session/update` notification during a prompt turn. The discriminant is the `sessionUpdate` field inside `update`:

| `sessionUpdate` value | When emitted | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_message_chunk` | Each streaming text token | `content.type = "text"`, `content.text` |
| `agent_thought_chunk` | Internal reasoning tokens (when enabled) | `content.type = "text"`, `content.text` |
| `tool_call` | Tool call initiated | `toolCallId`, `title`, `kind`, `status: "pending"`, `rawInput` |
| `tool_call_update` | Tool call completed | `toolCallId`, `status: "finished"`, `rawOutput`, `content[]` |

`toolCallId` on `tool_call` and `tool_call_update` are stable and correlated — the update completing a call carries the same `toolCallId` as the one that opened it.

The `name` field on `tool_call_update` is a ZeroClaw extension (not required by the base ACP spec). Clients can use it for display; it's safe to ignore.

### `session/request_permission` (agent → client, outbound request)

When a tool requires user approval (via `always_ask` in the autonomy config, or the `ask_user`/`escalate_to_human` tools), ZeroClaw issues a **JSON-RPC request** from agent to client. The client must reply with a result before the tool call proceeds.

```json
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"zc-out-0","method":"session/request_permission","params":{
    "sessionId": "s-ab12cd",
    "options": [
      {"optionId": "allow-once",  "name": "Allow once",  "kind": "allow_once"},
      {"optionId": "allow-always","name": "Always allow","kind": "allow_always"},
      {"optionId": "reject-once", "name": "Reject",      "kind": "reject_once"}
    ],
    "toolCall": {
      "toolCallId": "approval-...",
      "title": "Approve shell?",
      "kind": "execute",
      "status": "pending",
      "rawInput": {"tool": "shell", "summary": "git status --short"},
      "content": [{"type": "content", "content": {"type": "text", "text": "git status --short"}}]
    }
  }}
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"zc-out-0","result":{
    "outcome": {"outcome": "selected", "optionId": "allow-once"}
  }}
```

The server-issued id (`"zc-out-N"`) is always a string prefixed `zc-out-` — disjoint from any integer or string ids the client uses for its own requests.

Response shape:
- `{"outcome": {"outcome": "selected", "optionId": "<id>"}}` — user picked an option
- `{"outcome": {"outcome": "cancelled"}}` — user dismissed the prompt

If the client never replies (crash, network drop, user closes IDE), the request times out after `sessionTimeoutSecs` and the tool call is denied.

`ask_user` uses the same `session/request_permission` mechanism, mapping the question's `choices` to permission options. Free-form (no-choices) `ask_user` is not supported until the [ACP elicitation RFD](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/blob/main/docs/rfds/elicitation.mdx) lands. Calling `ask_user` without `choices` on an ACP session fast-fails with a clear error.

### `session/stop` _(ZeroClaw extension)_

Cleanly end a session. Not in the base ACP spec — ZeroClaw-specific. If a future ACP spec revision adds `session/stop` with different semantics, this will be renamed `_meta/session/stop`.

```json
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"session/stop","params":{"sessionId":"s-ab12cd"}}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"result":{"stopped":true}}
```

### `session/update` (client → server) _(ZeroClaw extension)_

ZeroClaw also accepts inbound `session/update` (and the legacy `session/event` alias) notifications from the client for custom event injection. Not in the base ACP spec — ZeroClaw-specific. If the ACP spec later defines an inbound `session/update` with different semantics, this will be renamed `_meta/session/update`.

## Configuration

```toml
[acp]
max_sessions = 10
session_timeout_secs = 3600       # idle sessions killed after 1 hour
```

When running `zeroclaw acp` as a subprocess, the command starts the server unconditionally. When running as a daemon, the gateway exposes ACP over WebSocket at `/acp` with no additional config required.

## Running

**As a subprocess (typical IDE integration):**

```bash
zeroclaw acp
```

The binary reads stdin, writes stdout, exits on EOF.

**As a WebSocket service (daemon mode):**

Start the daemon normally. The gateway always exposes ACP over WebSocket at the `/acp` endpoint — no extra config flag is required.

## Version compatibility

ACP v0 clients (using the flat `{streaming, maxSessions, ...}` initialize response and `kind: "text"|"tool_call"` session/update shape) will see deserialization errors on connecting to a v1 server. The discriminants and envelope shapes changed in a breaking way. Upgrade steps:

- Use `sessionUpdate` (not `kind`) to discriminate `session/update` notifications.
- Parse `session/prompt` results as `{sessionId, stopReason, content}` (not `{finished, usage}`).
- Implement `session/request_permission` response handling — the approval mechanism moved from a server notification to a client-answered RPC.
- Drop the `systemPrompt` param from `session/new` — it is not read.

## Security

ACP inherits the running config's autonomy level. When `[autonomy] level = "supervised"`, medium-risk tool calls trigger approval via the ACP back-channel — a `session/request_permission` outbound request the client must acknowledge. In `full` mode, tool calls execute without approval and `workspace_only` is implicitly disabled (the agent can reach paths outside the session cwd); `forbidden_paths` still apply.

The `cwd` from `session/new` becomes the `SecurityPolicy` workspace boundary used by all file and shell tools for that session. Note: the agent's system prompt currently reflects the daemon's global `workspace_dir` rather than the session `cwd` — this does not affect enforcement, only the directory the model believes it is working in.
