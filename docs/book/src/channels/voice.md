# Voice & Telephony

Real-time voice input and output. Several channels cover the matrix: inbound calls, local microphone wake, outbound speech synthesis, SIP-grade real-time conversation, and a hosted realtime speech-to-speech broker.

## ClawdTalk (real-time SIP)

Full-duplex SIP voice powered by Telnyx. The agent talks over a real phone call (inbound or outbound). Supports barge-in, mid-turn tool use, and regional number provisioning.

{{#config-fields channels.clawdtalk}}

`api_key` (Telnyx) and `webhook_secret` are secrets:

{{#secret-config channels.clawdtalk.<alias>.api_key}}

**Pair with:** a `telnyx` model provider for the brain and ensure your Telnyx account has a SIP connection with the correct webhook URL pointed at the ZeroClaw gateway.

## Voice Call (Twilio / Telnyx / Plivo)

Traditional carrier voice: the agent picks up, transcribes the caller, replies with TTS. Higher latency than ClawdTalk but works with any regular phone number and doesn't require SIP trunk provisioning. Outbound calls hit `from_number` and require operator approval when `require_outbound_approval` is on.

{{#config-fields channels.voice_call}}

## Voice Wake (local wake-word)

Runs locally, listens on the mic, triggers agent interaction when it hears the wake phrase. Useful for:

- Physical voice assistants on SBCs
- Desktop "hotword → ask" workflows
- Always-listening home-automation agents

The agent doesn't send audio anywhere; wake detection is local. Only post-wake speech is captured and (separately) transcribed before reaching the LLM.

{{#config-fields channels.voice_wake}}

> **Build flag:** Voice Wake is gated by the `voice-wake` cargo feature on `zeroclaw-channels`. Build with `--features voice-wake` to include it.
> On Android, Voice Wake requires Android 8 (API level 26) or newer.

## Speech-to-Speech Broker (Gemini Live)

A realtime bidirectional voice model (Gemini Live) owns the human-facing call
audio and speaks with the caller directly; it reaches the ZeroClaw agent
through exactly one bridge function, `consult_agent`, and relays the agent's
settled reply back in its own words. The voice model never touches tools;
only the agent does, via the normal agent/tool pipeline.

```toml
[channels.speech_to_speech.desk]
enabled = true
model_kind = "native_audio"
model = "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"
voice = "Autonoe"
activation = "hotkey_toggle"
broker_persona_path = "personas/broker.md"

[agents.primary]
channels = ["speech_to_speech.desk"]
```

`voice` defaults per `model_kind` when omitted (`Autonoe` for `native_audio`,
a Kore-class voice for `half_cascade`), so it's safe to drop from a minimal
config. `broker_persona_path` is resolved relative to, and confined to, the
agent's workspace; it never falls back to or reads `AGENTS.md`.

> **Build flag:** Speech-to-Speech is gated by the `channel-speech-to-speech`
> cargo feature on `zeroclaw-channels` and is **off by default**. Build with
> `--features channel-speech-to-speech` to include it. As of this writing the

**Privacy & cost.** A live session streams caller audio, and the transcripts
and prompts derived from it, to the speech backend provider (Google Gemini
Live). That provider may retain the audio, transcripts, and prompts it
receives, and session resumption can extend retention on the order of ~24h
beyond a single session. Input and output transcription, when enabled, is
billed as text tokens on top of the audio usage. ZeroClaw raises a startup
warning (`speech_to_speech_provider_retention`) for each enabled alias so the
operator sees this next to the alias they turned on.

{{#config-fields channels.speech_to_speech}}

## TTS (outbound speech synthesis)

TTS is an output service channels call into, not its own inbound channel. Global defaults live under `tts`. TTS provider instances are configured under `providers.tts.<type>.<alias>` (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Google, Edge, Piper) and selected per agent via the agent's `tts_provider`. See [Model Providers](../providers/overview.md) for the provider entries and per-agent wiring. Provider API keys are secrets; set them through the gateway, zerocode, or `zeroclaw config set`, never in plaintext.

## Latency budget

Speech feels real-time below ~500 ms end-to-end. Practical budgets:

| Component | Typical latency |
|---|---|
| Wake detection (local) | <100 ms |
| STT (Whisper local) | 300–800 ms per utterance |
| LLM first-token | 100–2000 ms (model dependent) |
| TTS first-audio | 200–700 ms |
| Network (cellular / PSTN) | 100–300 ms RTT |

ClawdTalk shortcuts several of these by keeping the audio stream live; regular `voice_call` incurs STT + LLM + TTS sequentially.

## STT

Speech-to-text is configured separately from the voice channels; see the `[transcription]` config in the [Config reference](../reference/config.md). Voice channels invoke whichever transcription provider is active when they need to turn audio into text.

## Hardware notes

For always-on voice on an SBC:

- USB mic: any UAC-compliant mic works. `arecord -l` to verify the OS sees it.
- Speaker: either USB audio out or the SBC's onboard jack; pick the OS default device for the user the daemon runs as.
- Microphones with built-in AEC (acoustic echo cancellation) dramatically improve wake reliability when the speaker is nearby.

See [Hardware → Android](../hardware/android-setup.md) for Android-specific audio setup.
