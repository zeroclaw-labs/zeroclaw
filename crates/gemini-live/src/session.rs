//! The reconnect/resumption session driver and the crate's public API.
//!
//! [`Session`] owns exactly one thing: the *connection lifecycle*. It connects,
//! sends `setup`, drives the transport, parses server frames into [`Event`]s,
//! remembers the session-resumption handle, and — on a resumable close —
//! reconnects with backoff and transparently resumes.
//!
//! The lifecycle runs in an **internal `tokio::spawn`ed task** that owns the
//! transport and the reconnect/backoff loop. The public API is therefore
//! *cancel-safe*: [`Session::recv_event`] is a plain `mpsc` receive (the
//! reconnect loop lives in the task, never in the caller's `select!`, so a
//! caller that races `recv_event` against other futures can never cancel a
//! reconnect mid-flight), and the `send_*` methods enqueue a command to the task
//! over a channel (they take `&self`). This is the fix for the reconnect
//! *starvation* that a caller-driven `next_event` racing a ~20 ms audio arm
//! would cause: every audio frame used to cancel the backoff sleep so the
//! reconnect never completed. Now the task drains (and discards) audio commands
//! while it is reconnecting, and the backoff runs to completion regardless of
//! caller traffic.
//!
//! It deliberately does **not** own call semantics: the greeting timer, energy
//! VAD, audio-forwarding decisions, RESUME_CUE/GREET_CUE wording, the uplink
//! drain, or `end_call` handling. Those live in the caller (kutsu), built on
//! top of this API — the caller reacts to `SessionOpened { is_reconnect, resumed }`
//! and decides what to send via [`Session::send_audio`] /
//! [`Session::send_client_text`] / [`Session::send_tool_response`].
//!
//! The reconnect/backoff policy is ported from kutsu's original `gemini_live`:
//! backoff 0.3s → ×2 → max 5s; the stored resumption handle is dropped as stale
//! after `HANDLE_DROP_AFTER` consecutive failed connects; and the *initial*
//! connect applies the same bounded backoff+retry so a transient blip during the
//! SIP ring never kills the call.
