//! Non-fatal validation warnings — config that loads and validates
//! successfully (i.e. `Config::validate()` returns `Ok(())`) but will fail
//! at agent runtime because of a logical inconsistency the schema can't
//! enforce structurally.

use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

/// One non-fatal validation issue surfaced after a successful save.
///
/// Stable codes (extend as new warnings are added):
/// - `memory_semantic_search_without_embedder`: `memory.search_mode` requests
///   vector search on sqlite memory, but no effective embedder is configured.
/// - `memory_config_knob_inert`: a `[memory]` knob is set to a non-default
///   value but has no runtime consumer yet, so it currently has no effect
///   (see `validate_memory_semantics` in `schema.rs` for the current list).
/// - `context_compression_unsupported`: a `runtime_profiles.<alias>.context_compression`
///   knob (`enabled = true`, or any other field set to a non-default value)
///   has no runtime consumer — the context compressor was removed —
///   so it currently has no effect. One warning per non-default field (see
///   `collect_context_compression_ignored_warnings` in `schema.rs`).
