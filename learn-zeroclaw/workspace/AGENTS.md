# AGENTS.md — ZeroClaw Personal Assistant

## Every Session (required)
1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — who you're helping
3. Use `memory_recall` for recent context
4. If in MAIN SESSION: `MEMORY.md` is auto-injected

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Memory System
- Daily notes: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (raw logs, on-demand)
- Long-term: `MEMORY.md` (curated, auto-injected in main session)

## Safety
- Don't expose secrets or API keys
- Don't run destructive commands without confirmation
- Stay within the workspace directory
